You have reached the blog of {{< external-link text="jreyesr" link="https://github.com/jreyesr" >}}!

Within this blog thou shall find only the finest random articles (i.e., no specific theme is planned, mostly because I don't think I could produce more than two articles about the same subject). The only constant will be software development, as you would expect from a Github user.

<!--more-->

There is also no schedule. I ~~may~~ will run out of ideas frequently.

That being said, here are some ideas that are being planned:

* Writeups about writing {{< external-link text="Steampipe" title="Steampipe" link="https://steampipe.io/" >}} plugins
* Reverse engineering a ~~spyware~~ time-tracking app that is used to ~~micro-manage you~~ help you make informed decisions about your activities and achieve Ultimate Efficiency&trade;. With {{< external-link text="Frida" link="https://frida.re" >}}. Also with dashboards, because why not? 
* Writing a {{< external-link text="Oso" title="Oso" link="https://www.osohq.com/" >}} data adapter from scratch
* An introduction to {{< external-link text="Cloudflare Zero Trust" link="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/zero-trust-network-access/" >}}, from the perspective of an individual user (i.e., not a company trying to secure access to private networks, but a single person wanting to access a few services, in the style of {{< external-link text="Ngrok" link="https://ngrok.com/" >}})
* An introduction to multivariable minimization with discontinuities in Python, as applied to the very important question of "Is my cellphone plan balance going down by itself? If so, by how much? If I add $1.00, how much time will it take for it to disappear?"
* Exploring [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/). How easy is it to use? What is its use case, if any? Is it any easier to use than a plain SQL database + ORM? Would I use it again? "Designed for devs, not suits" really sounds nice ðŸ™‚

If some of those articles seem interesting, you may want to [subscribe](/index.xml) to the RSS feed, for when the articles actually get published. Or not. I don't know if it's considered good form to ask for a subscription before writing any actual articles. Do people even use RSS anymore?

Anywayyy. That's it for the introduction. Hope you get something useful out of the articles! [^1]

[^1]: Once they exist, that is.
