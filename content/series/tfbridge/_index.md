name: Connecting Steampipe to Terraform Data Sources
description: A series that documents the development of a Steampipe plugin that provides access to (any?) Data Source provided by a Terraform provider, so users can query data via SQL without having to write a dedicated Steampipe plugin, thereby increasing the amount of data that Steampipe can access.
